Hi, I'm Andrew and welcome to my GitHub page! I am a native New Yorker and a junior studying Computer and Data Science at New York University. I enjoy working with datasets because we make new data every day and analyzing them helps me understand where we are as a society and in that specific scenario. Data analysis can help us make better decisions. I have various interests and am interested in leveraging my data science skills through my interests.
